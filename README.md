# List-Manipulation
Creating lists and manipulating their lengths and values.

I have written a few functions which interact with lists in various ways, 
mainly as an exercise in function design and general Python programming. 

While there may be modules out there that perform these functions more elegantly, 
I wanted to try to construct them from scratch.

It is especially interesting to call the functions from within one another and 
to build up the functionality as a whole.

Also, I will continue adding new functions as I get ideas for new ones. 
There may be comments lingering that I use for note-taking and testing.
